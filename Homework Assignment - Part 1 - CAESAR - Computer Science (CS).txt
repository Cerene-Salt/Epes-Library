HOMEWORKS Assignment.Created in Python code.

FIRST-ADD TWO NUMBERS AND PRINT RESULT ASKING THE USER TO INPUT THE TWO NUMBERS;
SECOND-CHECK IF NUMBER ENTERED BY THE USER IS ODD OR EVEN;
THIRD-CALCULATE FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER ENTERED BY THE USER;
FOURTH-COUNT NUMBER OF VOWELS IN A STRING ENTERED BY THE USER;
FIFTH-CREATE A FUNCTION CALLED COUNT which INPUTS AN INTEGER N AND PRINTS FROM 0 TO N USING A LOOP.

FIRST TASK - ADDITTION

#THIS CODE WILL ADD TO NUMBERS INPUT BY THE USER AND PRINT THE RESULT
w= float(input("Enter the first number:"))
h = float(input("Enter the second number:"))
result = ( w + h)
print("The result of this addition is",result)

SECOND TASK - ODD OR EVEN NUMBERS

#Let´s know make the user insert values to verify if a number is even or odd

Number = int(input("Insert a value here to check if is even or odd:"))

#Now we use the modulo operator

if Number %2==0:
 print("The number", Number, " is even.")
else:
 print("The number", Number, "is odd.")

THIRD TASK - FACTORIAL 

#This program will write the factorial of n numbers
#The style will be interactive, since the user will insert the number.
n= int(input("Enter a non-negative integer:"))
#We want to make sure that the factorials obey also the conditions of 0 and 1
if n<0:
    print("Failed!Please enter a positive number")
elif n== 0 or n==1:
    print("The factorial of", n, " is 1")
else:
    factorial=1
    for i in range (1,n+1):
        factorial*=i
        
#And the final step
print("the factorial of", n, "is", factorial)

FOURTH TASK - COUNT VOWELS

#In this program, we´re finding the number of vowls in a text or phrase
# Vowls are letters represented as a, e , i, o, u. 
#In this code, we´ll also include the uppercult letters.

text= input("Insert your text here:")
vowelCount= 0

for char in text:
    if char == "a" or char == "A":
        vowelCount = vowelCount + 1
    elif char =="e" or char == "E":
        vowelCount = vowelCount + 1
    elif char =="i" or char == "I":
        vowelCount = vowelCount + 1
    elif char == "o" or char == "O":
        vowelCount = vowelCount + 1
    elif char == "u" or char == "U":
        vowelCount = vowelCount + 1
    else :
        pass 
    #Since all letters must obey the vowls conditions,
#Every other is disposable

print("The number os vowels is ", str(vowelCount))


FIFTH - COUNT FUNCTION

#COUNT FUNCTION, IT INPUTS AN INTEGER N AND PRINTS
# FROM 0 TO N  USING A LOOP.
print("------------------------------------------")
def count(N):
    for i in range(N + 1):
        print(i)
count(9)
